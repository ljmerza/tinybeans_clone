# ADR-012 Migration Progress

This document tracks the migration of components to use the new ADR-012 notification strategy.

**Last Updated:** December 2024  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 In Progress

## Overview

We are migrating components in phases, starting with high-traffic authentication flows and progressing to less critical features.

## Phase 1: Authentication Flows (CURRENT)

High-priority authentication components and endpoints.

### Backend Views

## Testing Checklist

### Auth Flow Testing
- [ ] Signup with validation errors
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials
- [ ] Login with 2FA
- [ ] Password reset request
- [ ] Password reset confirm
- [ ] Email verification
- [ ] Language switching during auth
- [ ] Error messages display correctly
- [ ] Success messages show appropriately

### Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Mobile browsers

## Known Issues

### Current
- None reported yet (newly migrated)

### Resolved
- N/A

## Team Notes

### Best Practices Learned
1. Always extract both field and general errors
2. Clear error states before new submissions
3. Provide meaningful fallback messages
4. Test with both English and Spanish
5. Keep translation keys descriptive

### Common Pitfalls
1. ❌ Forgetting to add translation keys for both languages
2. ❌ Not clearing error state between submissions
3. ❌ Mixing old and new hooks in same component
4. ❌ Auto-toast still enabled on old client

### Tips
- Use `useApiMessages()` hook for consistency
- Always test error scenarios
- Check translation files before committing
- Reference EXAMPLES.tsx for patterns
- Update this document as you migrate

### Files Changed
- Backend: 8 files
- Frontend: 15 files
