## Large Django Module Split Candidates

### Purpose
- Highlight Django modules/tests that have grown past ~390 lines and now mix multiple responsibilities.
- Give direction for where to split or refactor so future changes stay reviewable and merge-friendly.

### Selection Criteria
- Source files under `mysite/` that exceeded ~390 lines per `wc -l`.
- Priority ordering is by size (largest first) because conflicts and review pain scale with line count.
- Suggestions favor splitting along feature boundaries or extracting helpers into `services.py`.

### Candidates

| File | Lines | Why It Feels Overgrown | Suggested Refactor |

### Next Actions
- Pick the next production module (e.g., `mysite/circles/views/invitations.py`) and draft a concrete split plan plus ownership.
- After each refactor, add smoke tests (or reorganize existing ones) to confirm module boundaries stayed intact.

### Refactor Progress
- [x] `mysite/auth/views/two_factor.py` split into `setup.py`, `management.py`, `recovery.py`, `trusted_devices.py`, and `login.py` (re-exported via `mysite/auth/views/two_factor/__init__.py`).
- [x] `mysite/auth/tests/test_2fa_api.py` replaced with targeted modules per flow (`test_2fa_setup_api.py`, `test_2fa_management_api.py`, `test_2fa_recovery_api.py`, `test_trusted_devices_api.py`) plus `tests/helpers.py`.
- [x] `mysite/auth/tests/test_2fa_services.py` split into `test_otp_service.py`, `test_totp_service.py`, `test_recovery_code_service.py`, `test_trusted_device_service.py`, and `test_rate_limiting_service.py` with shared helpers in `conftest.py`.
- [x] `mysite/users/tests/test_serializers.py` split auth serializers to `auth/tests/test_auth_serializers.py` and user serializers to `test_user_serializers.py`, `test_circle_serializers.py`, and `test_child_profile_serializers.py`.
- [x] `mysite/config/settings/base.py` split into thematic modules (`auth.py`, `drf.py`, `security.py`, `storage.py`, `celery.py`, `cache.py`, `email.py`) with `base.py` importing from all modules.
- [x] `mysite/users/tests/test_edge_cases.py` split into feature-specific test modules (`auth/tests/test_auth_edge_cases.py`, `circles/tests/test_circle_edge_cases.py`, `users/tests/test_child_profile_edge_cases.py`, `users/tests/test_notification_preferences.py`, `users/tests/test_permission_edge_cases.py`).
- [x] `mysite/circles/views/invitations.py` split into `views/invitations/admin.py` (admin actions), `views/invitations/invitee.py` (invitee actions), with shared logic extracted to `services/invitation_service.py`. All views re-exported from `views/invitations/__init__.py`.
- [x] `mysite/users/tests/test_invitation_roles.py` split into `circles/tests/test_invitation_serializers.py` (serializer validation), `circles/tests/test_invitation_admin_permissions.py` (admin CRUD), `circles/tests/test_invitation_workflow.py` (end-to-end flows), with shared fixtures in `circles/tests/conftest.py`. Relocated from users/tests to circles/tests.
- [x] `mysite/auth/services/google_oauth_service.py` split into specialized sub-services in `oauth/` subdirectory: `pkce_state_service.py` (PKCE and state management, 175 lines), `google_api_service.py` (Google API interactions, 144 lines), and `account_linking_service.py` (account linking/unlinking, 213 lines). Main service reduced from 485 to 226 lines and now focuses on orchestration.
- [x] `mysite/auth/views/google.py` split into specialized view modules in `google_oauth/` subdirectory: `initiate.py` (OAuth flow initiation, 102 lines), `callback.py` (OAuth callback handling, 171 lines), `linking.py` (account linking/unlinking, 207 lines), and `helpers.py` (shared utilities, 57 lines). Main file reduced from 462 to 24 lines for re-exports.
- [x] `mysite/auth/tests/test_2fa_login.py` split into focused test modules: `test_2fa_login_success.py` (256 lines, happy-path login and verification flows), `test_2fa_login_lockout.py` (109 lines, rate limiting and verification failures), and `test_2fa_trusted_devices.py` (131 lines, trusted device and remember-me functionality). Test failures now clearly indicate which area has regressed.
- [x] `mysite/auth/tests/test_oauth_service.py` split into operation-specific test modules: `test_google_oauth_state.py` (174 lines, PKCE and state token validation), `test_google_oauth_token_exchange.py` (58 lines, token exchange with Google), and `test_google_oauth_account_operations.py` (192 lines, user creation, linking, and unlinking). Shared fixtures extracted to `conftest.py`. Test failures now clearly map to specific OAuth operations.
- [x] `mysite/keeps/views/keeps.py` - Upload orchestration and status polling already separated in dedicated file. Renamed `upload_views.py` to `uploads.py` (197 lines) for naming consistency. Core CRUD operations remain in `keeps.py` (407 lines with 4 viewsets). Clean separation of upload concerns from CRUD logic.
