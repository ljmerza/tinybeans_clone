# ADR Quick Reference

## üéØ When Do I Need an ADR?

Ask yourself: **"Will this decision impact how others build or maintain the system?"**

### ‚úÖ YES - Write an ADR for:
- Choosing a new technology, framework, or library
- Changing architectural patterns (e.g., moving from REST to GraphQL)
- Major refactoring decisions
- Database schema changes that affect multiple features
- Authentication/security mechanism changes
- API design patterns and conventions
- Infrastructure and deployment strategy changes
- Development workflow changes affecting the whole team

### ‚ùå NO - Skip ADR for:
- Bug fixes (document in commit messages)
- Minor UI changes
- Code style preferences (use linter rules instead)
- Temporary workarounds
- Implementation details within a single feature
- Configuration changes without architectural impact

---

## üìù 5-Minute ADR Guide

### Step 1: Copy Template (30 seconds)
```bash
cd docs/architecture/adr
cp ADR-TEMPLATE.md ADR-010-MY-DECISION.md
```

### Step 2: Fill Required Sections (3 minutes)

**Must fill:**
1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive (e.g., "Switch from Redux to TanStack Query")
2. **Status**: Start with "Proposed"
3. **Context**: Why is this decision needed? What's the problem?
4. **Decision**: What did you decide to do? Be specific.
5. **Alternatives**: What else did you consider? Why not those?
6. **Consequences**: What's the impact? (pros and cons)

**Optional but helpful:**
- Implementation plan
- Code examples
- Diagrams
- Risks and mitigations

### Step 3: Review & Approve (varies)
- Share with team
- Gather feedback
- Update based on input
- Get sign-offs
- Change status to "Accepted"

### Step 4: Finalize (1 minute)
- Add to README index
- Commit to repository
- Reference in architecture.md if relevant

## üìã The 5 Essential Sections

### 1. Context
**What:** Describe the current situation and problem  
**Why:** Future readers need to understand the landscape  
**Length:** 3-5 paragraphs

```markdown
### Current State
- We're using Redux for all state management
- 80% of our state is server data
- Complex boilerplate for simple API calls

### Problem
- Too much boilerplate reduces developer velocity
- Cache invalidation is manual and error-prone
- No built-in loading/error states
```

### 2. Decision
**What:** The choice you made  
**Why:** This is the record of what was decided  
**Length:** 1-3 paragraphs + bullet points

```markdown
We will use TanStack Query for server state management
and TanStack Store only for client state.

Implementation:
- Migrate all API calls to TanStack Query hooks
- Use TanStack Store only for UI state (theme, sidebar, etc.)
- Complete migration in 2 sprints
```

### 3. Alternatives Considered
**What:** Other options you evaluated  
**Why:** Shows due diligence, helps future decisions  
**Length:** 2-4 alternatives

```markdown
### Alternative 1: Keep Redux
**Pros**: Team knows it, no migration cost
**Cons**: Boilerplate remains, cache management still manual
**Why Rejected**: Benefits don't outweigh long-term productivity

### Alternative 2: Use SWR
**Pros**: Smaller bundle size than TanStack Query
**Cons**: Less feature-rich, smaller ecosystem
**Why Rejected**: TanStack Query better TypeScript support
```

### 4. Consequences
**What:** Positive and negative impacts  
**Why:** Every decision has trade-offs  
**Length:** 3-6 bullet points each

```markdown
### Positive
- ‚úÖ Automatic caching and refetching
- ‚úÖ Built-in loading/error states
- ‚úÖ 40% less boilerplate code

### Negative
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Learning curve for team
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration effort: 2 sprints
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly larger bundle (+15KB)
```

### 5. Implementation Details
**What:** How to actually do it  
**Why:** Makes the ADR actionable  
**Length:** Code examples, diagrams, steps

```typescript
// Before (Redux)
const dispatch = useDispatch();
const loading = useSelector(state => state.users.loading);

// After (TanStack Query)
const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['users'],
  queryFn: fetchUsers,
});
```

## üé® ADR Template Cheat Sheet

### Minimal ADR (10 minutes)
Fill these sections only:
- Title & Status
- Context (why needed)
- Decision (what chosen)
- Alternatives (what else considered)
- Consequences (pros/cons)

### Standard ADR (30 minutes)
Add to minimal:
- Implementation plan
- Code examples
- Testing strategy
- Migration path

### Comprehensive ADR (1-2 hours)
Add to standard:
- Architecture diagrams
- Performance analysis
- Security implications
- Monitoring plan
- Success criteria

## üí° Pro Tips

### Writing Tips
1. **Start with Context**: Write the "Context" section first, it's easiest
2. **Use Examples**: Code snippets are worth 1000 words
3. **Be Specific**: "Use TanStack Query" not "Improve state management"
4. **Include Numbers**: "Reduces bundle by 40KB" not "Smaller bundle"
5. **Link Everything**: Reference other ADRs, docs, external resources

### Common Mistakes
1. ‚ùå **Too Late**: Writing ADR after implementation
   - ‚úÖ **Fix**: Write while deciding, even if "Proposed"

2. ‚ùå **Too Abstract**: "We will improve performance"
   - ‚úÖ **Fix**: "We will implement Redis caching for user queries"

3. ‚ùå **No Alternatives**: Only documents chosen option
   - ‚úÖ **Fix**: Show 2-3 alternatives you considered

4. ‚ùå **Missing Consequences**: Only lists benefits
   - ‚úÖ **Fix**: Include trade-offs and costs

5. ‚ùå **No Code Examples**: Pure prose
   - ‚úÖ **Fix**: Add actual code/config snippets

### Review Checklist
Before submitting for review:
- [ ] Title is clear and specific
- [ ] Context explains the "why"
- [ ] Decision is unambiguous
- [ ] 2+ alternatives documented
- [ ] Both pros and cons listed
- [ ] Code examples included (if applicable)
- [ ] Diagrams added (if helpful)
- [ ] Status is "Proposed"
