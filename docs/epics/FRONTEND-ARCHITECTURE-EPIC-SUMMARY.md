# Frontend Architecture Migration - Epic Summary

**Project**: Frontend File Architecture Reorganization  
**Related ADR**: [ADR-011: Frontend File Architecture](../architecture/adr/ADR-011-FRONTEND-FILE-ARCHITECTURE.md)  
**Status**: Planning  
**Overall Priority**: P1 - High Priority (Developer Experience & Maintainability)  
**Total Estimated Effort**: 21 story points across 4 epics  
**Timeline**: 4 weeks (1 epic per week)

---

## Vision

Transform the frontend codebase from a mixed, unclear file organization to a clear, scalable feature-based architecture that improves developer productivity and code maintainability.

---

## Current State Problems

### Critical Issues
1. **Confusion**: Duplicate route files in `routes/` and `modules/*/routes.*.tsx`
2. **Inconsistency**: No clear pattern for where to place new code
3. **Discoverability**: Hard to find all files related to a feature
4. **Scalability**: Pattern doesn't support growing feature set
5. **Onboarding**: New developers struggle to understand organization

### Impact Metrics
- **Developer Confusion**: ~30% of PR comments ask "where should this file go?"
- **File Discovery Time**: Average 2-5 minutes to find feature-related code
- **Code Review Friction**: Inconsistent patterns lead to debates
- **Onboarding Time**: 2+ days to understand current structure

## Target State

### New Architecture
```
src/
├── routes/              File-based routing (TanStack Router)
│   ├── login.tsx       Thin route definitions
│   └── 2fa/            Nested routes
│
├── features/            Feature modules (business logic)
│   ├── auth/           Authentication feature
│   │   ├── index.ts    Public exports
│   │   ├── components/ Feature components
│   │   ├── hooks/      Feature hooks
│   │   ├── api/        API clients

```

### Success Metrics
- **Zero duplicate route files**
- **100% features follow standard structure**
- **< 30 seconds** to locate any feature file
- **Zero "where does this go?" questions** in code reviews
- **50% reduction** in onboarding time for file structure

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
None identified - migration is incremental and well-planned

### Medium Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking auth flows during migration | 30% | High | Comprehensive testing after each change, feature flags |
| Import path errors across codebase | 40% | Medium | Automated find/replace, thorough code review |
| Team adoption resistance | 20% | Medium | Clear documentation, training, show early wins |

### Low Risks
- Build configuration issues (mitigated by testing in Phase 1)
- Performance degradation (unlikely with structure changes)

### Updates
- **Daily**: Standup updates on migration progress
- **Weekly**: Demo of completed stories
- **End of Epic**: Retrospective and lessons learned

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Arise

**Week 1-2 (Early Phase)**:
- Minimal code changes, easy to revert
- Rollback: Remove `features/` directory, restore configs

**Week 3-4 (Deep Migration)**:
- Use git branches for each epic
- Rollback: Revert to previous epic's branch
- Keep old `modules/` directory until Week 4

### Rollback Triggers
1. **Critical**: Auth or 2FA completely broken in production
2. **Major**: >3 days behind schedule with no clear path forward
3. **Blocker**: Unforeseen technical limitation discovered

---

## Team Resources

### Required
- **1 Senior Frontend Developer**: Lead migration, code reviews
- **1-2 Mid-level Developers**: Execute migration stories
- **Tech Lead**: Architecture decisions, approvals

### Time Commitment
- **Week 1**: 40% team capacity
- **Week 2-3**: 60% team capacity (migration weeks)
