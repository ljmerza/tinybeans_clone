# Story 1.4: Invitee Onboarding UX and Notifications

## Status
- Draft

## Story
**As a** circle invitee,  
**I want** a clear onboarding/acceptance experience,  
**so that** I know when I’ve joined the circle and what to do next.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. React onboarding flow handles magic-link and OAuth callbacks, prompting for 2FA where required.  
2. Pending/accepted/declined/expired paths each show distinct screens following existing UX patterns.  
3. Toasts and emails confirm acceptance or decline; admins receive in-app notifications when invite status changes.  
4. Analytics/logging capture invite acceptance funnel events for future metrics.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement invite landing/acceptance pages handling magic link & OAuth callbacks (AC 1)  
  - [ ] Integrate 2FA prompts when backend signals requirement (AC 1)  
- [ ] Build UX for accepted/declined/expired states with reusable components (AC 2)  
- [ ] Trigger toast notifications and wire in-app notifications via existing stores (AC 3)  
- [ ] Coordinate with backend to emit events/logs and capture client analytics hooks (AC 3, AC 4)  
- [ ] Write Vitest coverage for state flows and snapshot key UI states (All ACs)

## Dev Notes
- Onboarding routes should live under `web/src/routes` (and `route-views`) using TanStack Router; ensure deep links from emails work.  
- Use existing authentication hooks/utilities in `web/src/features/auth` to coordinate with backend tokens.  
- Toasts come from `web/src/components/toast`; in-app notifications likely tie into messaging/notification store (validate existing pattern).  
- Email templates triggered by backend; ensure UI copy matches template messaging for consistency.  
- Add analytics instrumentation using current telemetry approach (check `web/src/lib/` or `integrations` for event emitter).  
- Provide graceful fallback for expired/invalid tokens with links to contact support.  
- Respect localization/i18n patterns defined in `web/src/i18n`.

### Testing
- Vitest + React Testing Library for flow coverage; mock router navigation and auth hooks.  
- Consider contract tests with backend schema to ensure UI handles all status values.  
- Run `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format` to maintain CI cleanliness.
