### 7. ✅ **API Response Interface Duplication** (COMPLETED)
- **Created:** `src/types/api.ts` with shared `ApiMessage` and `ApiResponse` types
- **Updated:** 3 files to import from shared types
- **Result:** Single source of truth for API types with comprehensive documentation
- **LOC Saved:** ~15-20 lines
- **Date:** December 2024

### 8. ✅ **Error Handling Patterns** (COMPLETED)
- **Created:** `src/features/auth/utils/errorHandling.ts` with `extractApiError()` utility
- **Updated:** 2 files to use utility function (`2fa/settings.tsx`, `2fa/setup/index.tsx`)
- **Result:** Consistent error message extraction with fallback chain
- **LOC Saved:** ~20 lines
- **Date:** December 2024

### 9. ✅ **2FA Navigation State** (COMPLETED)
- **Created:** `src/features/auth/utils/twoFactorNavigation.ts` with `handleTwoFactorRedirect()` utility
- **Updated:** `auth/hooks/authHooks.ts` to use utility function
- **Result:** Centralized 2FA redirect logic with consistent state handling
- **LOC Saved:** ~15 lines
- **Date:** December 2024

### 10. ✅ **Message Display Pattern** (COMPLETED)
- **Status:** Already handled by existing `useApiMessages` hook and `showAsToast` utility
- **Result:** Consistent message display across all auth operations
- **LOC Saved:** N/A (already centralized)
- **Date:** Pre-existing pattern

**Total Completed:** ~835 lines of duplicate code eliminated, 16+ files removed/consolidated

## Recommendations

### All Items Completed ✅
1. ✅ Confirm Dialog Components - Merged into single flexible component
2. ✅ Header Components - Created shared Header component
3. ✅ QueryClient Configuration - Removed unused file
4. ✅ Login Card Components - Consolidated into one component
5. ✅ 2FA Setup Wizard Steps - Created generic reusable components
6. ✅ 2FA Method Cards - Created generic card component
7. ✅ API Response Types - Centralized in src/types/
8. ✅ Error Handling Patterns - Created extractApiError utility
9. ✅ 2FA Navigation State - Created handleTwoFactorRedirect utility
10. ✅ Message Display Pattern - Already centralized via useApiMessages hook

---

## Architecture Improvements Completed

### Component Consolidation
- **Confirm Dialogs:** 2 files → 1 unified component
- **Header:** Extracted shared component, removed duplicate
- **Login Cards:** 2 files → 1 with better docs
- **2FA Setup Steps:** 9 duplicate files → 3 generic + 9 thin wrappers
- **2FA Method Cards:** 3 duplicate files → 1 generic + 3 thin wrappers

### Code Organization
- **Shared Types:** Created `src/types/api.ts` for common API interfaces
- **Generic Components:** Created reusable wizard and card components
- **Utility Functions:** Created `errorHandling.ts` and `twoFactorNavigation.ts` for common patterns
- **Documentation:** Added comprehensive JSDoc to all generic components and utilities

### Benefits Achieved
1. ✅ Single source of truth for shared patterns
2. ✅ Consistent UX across all 2FA methods
3. ✅ Easy to add new 2FA methods (just configure, don't implement)
4. ✅ Bug fixes benefit all instances automatically
5. ✅ Better type safety with centralized definitions
6. ✅ Improved maintainability with clear patterns
7. ✅ 100% backward compatibility maintained
8. ✅ Consistent error handling with proper fallback chains
9. ✅ Centralized 2FA redirect logic reduces mistakes

## Notes

- All completed fixes are production-ready and fully tested
- TypeScript compilation successful for all changes
- Backward compatibility maintained through re-exports
- Generic components include comprehensive documentation
- Remaining items are optional optimizations with minimal impact

## Tool Information

Initial analysis performed using custom Python script analyzing TypeScript/TSX files for:
- Duplicate function definitions
- Repeated code blocks (5+ line threshold)
- Similar component structures
- Shared patterns across files

Found 13 duplicate function patterns and 438 duplicate code blocks across 123 files.
